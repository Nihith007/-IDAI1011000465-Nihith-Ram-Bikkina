Unit 1 - AI-Based Smart Solutions: Designing Chatbots for Real-World Challenges

The Smart Campus Assistant is an AI-powered virtual guide developed to enhance navigation and communication across the campus. Designed using Google Dialogflow, this chatbot provides users—including students, parents, and faculty members—with instant access to essential campus information. It assists with locating departments, event venues, administrative offices, and facilities, as well as providing details such as office hours, transportation options, and campus policies.

By combining intelligent conversation design with user-focused functionality, the Smart Campus Assistant aims to create a more connected, efficient, and accessible campus environment for all members of the community.
